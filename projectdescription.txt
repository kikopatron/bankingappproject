Day 2
Create a Banking App
Prompt the User to Input their name
How much they would like to deposit?
How much they would like to withdraw?
And calculate the ending balance. 

Lastly ask would you like to continue after they did that one time: if they would then ask these questions 
all over again. (Hint: your going to have to use a type of loop here.) And also a if-else statement.
